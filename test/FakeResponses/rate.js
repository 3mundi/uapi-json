As for the hotel - relaxing, peaceful, helpful staff (who do speak english). Split level studio type rooms with views of the city, an excellent restaurant with great food and extremely helpful waiters (Ceklar deserves a mention as he was great, helped us out, nothing was too much trouble and was really friendly).

The restaurant is split as there is a terrace room where you can enjoy views of Vienna while you dine. You'll find that the locals smoke like chimneys and the terrace room would be the nominated smoking area, Im a none smoker myself but it is worth putting up with it to enjoy the views.

It is an absolutely beautiful hotel. The building is very grand and is white in colour on the outside. It looks just like a castle or palace. On the inside it is very large and just as lovely. Although it is big, it still feels cosy and welcoming, and not at all cold. You are greeted by the lovely people on reception. Most of them have excellent English and are extremely nice and helpful. The restaurant staff are also polite and welcoming. The cuisine is excellent and the meals, if not always large in quantity are certainly made up for in superb quality and taste, we had half-pension which was again brilliant. There is plenty of room in the restaurant, there is a large dining hall, a little corridor with tables in and a lovely terrace, also with many tables. I would advise you eat on the terrace if it is warm enough- the views are fantastic- you get to see all over Vienna- it is so beautiful. There are also about 30 acres of grounds where you can walk or play mini-golf etc. The rooms are spacious and are also very stylish, cosy and beautiful in keeping with the rest of the decor. They are large, although the bathrooms could do with being slightly larger. In the back rooms you get a beautiful view of Vienna, just like from the restaurant terrace. From the front you can see the cleverly done \"SW\" shaped hedge in the middle of the front lawn. The hotel is located at the top of the hill which accounts for the views and the minimal if any noise. It is a beautiful place to relax if you don't fancy going out. I am definitely going there again.","$":{"CommentId":"2278379","Date":"2002-08-25","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"It was great!

It can be a romantic get away esp during the winter. But once you walk in you'll find a lot of frowning faces from the wait staff at the restaurants to the reception desk.

All in all, it'll be a good 35-40 min trip. It's not bad but do note that the buses outside come every 30 mins. \nWe paid a lot for this hotel and did not feel it lived up to it's expectations. Room interior was not all that. Nothing that pleasing inside for the price you pay. If we ever go back, I'd stay closer to the central area where transporation is easier and I'll probably pay less.

We loved our stay there and would return like a shot if given the opportunity again. A winter stay is recommended especially to people from warmer climes.

There is no AC and no fans, so we resorted to wet towels to cool ourselves off at night.\n Just keep that in mind if you are traveling during hot weather. I think the hotel would be fine 90 percent of the time, but we hit the 10 percent that was stifling! Of course, it doesn't seem to bother Europeans at all, just us spoiled Americans!\n The lobby and terrace are gorgeous, but there are other drawbacks. We never once encountered a bellhop, and the front desk people were only mildly helpful compared to the personnel we dealt with in Prague and Salzburg. The food is not bad, but not anything to write home about either, and the service was so-so.\n I did not book this hotel myself, as I would never choose a hotel so far from the city center, although the public transportation is said to be excellent. One of my traveling companion insisted on using taxi cabs to get into Vienna, so I cannot comment on the bus.\n Again, the hotel grounds and lobby are beautiful, and so is the spectacular view of Vienna.","$":{"CommentId":"2278371","Date":"2006-07-22","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":" Free secure parking and free wireless internet was appreciated.\nRooms a little musty, suggest management open windows for a few hours before guests arrival considering age of this building.

The Wilheminenberg hotel is a refurbished castle, but lacks the class to make you feel like nobility.\nThe rooms are quite spacious (especially on the top floor); however, the hotel only lights every other lamp in the hotel, it could also use some further refurbishing (like a new elevator, some repainting at some places, etc). The hotel is also used as a site for continuing education, conferences, youth groups, etc. and it is adjacent to Vienna's HI youth hostel. It does lack a pool, unfortunately. All of these make it a mid-class hotel in a potentially 5-star environment. However, the staff was quite friendly, especially for Austrian standards.\nI did not experience the lack of air conditioning to be a big problem as the high-ceiling rooms were quite cool to begin with, even in the middle of a July heat wave.\nBreakfast and dinner were somewhat average. While this is -again- largely compensated by the spectacular view from the outside terrace, the variety of the food is a big problem if staying for more than a single or two nights, but public transportation to downtown Vienna is very handy through a bus (that rides about every 10 minutes) that goes straight to the U-Bahn. It does, however, take some 30 minutes to an hour (depending on traffic and where one is headed) to reach many points in central Vienna. However, because of this Wilhelminenhof is located in a forest-like environment that lends itself well to nature walks and the like. And again, the view is phenomenal and would handily beat any postcard I saw over the week I spent in Vienna. The walk down to Ottakreuz (the U-Bahn station) from the hotel is fairly nice and if you have some time (and reasonable health) it is well worth the effort.\nThe historic value and panorama make this hotel worth a visit, but consider the drawbacks of location, and more importantly, the fact that there is quite some room for improvement still.","$":{"CommentId":"2278369","Date":"2007-02-04","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":" Beatiful view to the city.

It's true that the bathrooms are tiny, but they are scrupulously clean and adequate. \nThe high points are certainly the view, the grounds, and the generous breakfast buffet. The site with its overview of the most beautiful city in the world (to me) was spectacular. We were driving, and as I mentioned, knew our way around well, but I could see that it would be a challenge for those not expecting to being well on the outskirts of a very large city.\nMy least favorite part was the general atmosphere of the hotel.

If your visiting Vienna to primarily visit the city centre (which my partner and myself did) it takes roughly 20-25 mins travel time, however, the public transport system in Vienna is top notch.

If and when I travel to Vienna again I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel, it really is everything you could ever want.","$":{"CommentId":"2278374","Date":"2015-10-30","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"Great building in a great location, clean room and decent breakfast, very good value for the weekend I stayed there. However the potential of the building is not fully realised and is does not inspire as much as it could. WiFi is ridiculously expensive. In good weather it would be great. The bus service from Ottakring is unbelievably good in terms of the frequency of the buses, even late evening. There is a very good restaurant about 200m below the hotel called Pradiger Stuhl.","$":{"CommentId":"2278373","Date":"2006-03-15","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"+Splendid view of Wien, ample garden, very comfortable, lot of parking, quiet location, superb \"classy\" building with solid walls and big windows.

The pictures do not do it justice; it is extremely large, looking imposing even from a distance.  We arrived at night and the place was impressively illuminated - let's just say the hotel is impossible to miss. \nWe stayed in December 2004 and could not fault the room, views or local transport.  The room itself was a studio bedroom split on two floors.  This was very different and my girlfriend and I appreciated the change from the normal box room with TV.\nLocation is not a problem.  All you need to do is jump on the 46b or 146b bus right outside the hotel; you do not even need to worry about the direction as the service loops around back to Ottakring.  Once at Ottakring itself, simply jump on the U3 to get anywhere in the city within 20-25 minutes.  We timed the journey: 20 minutes to Stephansplatz (the dead centre) with little fuss.\nThe only problem we had was with the staff, who got a couple of things wrong (i.e. didn't provide breakfast even when we left a card outside and phoned reception as required).  They were also a little grumpy, but we found this generally to be the case in Austria (sorry to the locals!).\nMy tip is to book 4 nights here with Expedia and then stay more centrally for another 4 nights.  We also stayed at La Meridien on the Ringstrasse (central road around Vienna) and found the combination of the two hotels worked perfectly.\nGood points: Fantastic building, views, room, breakfast AND location (the area is very picturesque).  The cleanliness also deserves a mention; very impressive.\nBad points: Lack of swimming pool (although there is one nearby), staff grumpiness and occassional lapse in service.\nOverall, this is to recommended.  You will not forget the Schloss.","$":{"CommentId":"2278384","Date":"2015-10-30","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"+Good location, panorama, parking and park","$":{"CommentId":"823362","Date":"2007-12-11","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"BK"}},{"_":"+The hotel is a liittle out of town, well worth the extra effort.

I imagine that you cook in summer.\nSUMMARY\nThis is an excellent hotel, scoring highly in every department.\nSITUATION\nIts location is delightful. It is high above the city, on the edge of the Vienna Woods. There are some delightful walks in the immediate vicinity but take advice on Tick-Born Encephalitis. The bus from Ottarkring stops bang outside but a cab from the city wonât break the bank.\nARCHITECTURE\nIt is a C18th hunting lodge and typical of its time. This means beautifully excessive, as the Count that had it built threw his money around. The terrace was closed, it being winter but we could still see how breathtaking it would be in summer. Clock the pictures on the hotelâs website.\nSERVICE\nI speak German but all of the staff (from chambermaids to reception) spoke English and were unfailingly polite, helpful and accommodating. The waiting staff in the restaurant merit special mention; they were exceptional. Reception helped us with all sorts, booking trips and visits.\nFACILITIES\nBreakfast is typically Germanic with cheese and cold meats. Something more Anglo-Saxon is available, for the feebly unadventurous. The restaurant is first rate, offering imaginative menus and many Austrian wines. The rooms are, er, amusing, being double-decker (your bedâs on a platform upstairs, cleverly creating more room downstairs).\nVALUE\nThis is a hotel of well above average comfort, more than warranting its 4-star rating. You pay a 4-start tariff - but not above the odds.","$":{"CommentId":"662299","Date":"2007-11-14","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"My wife and I had booked 7 nights in this hotel in a 'superior' class room.\nThe hotel represents itself as 4 star but it is far from that. The comfort and service in Holiday Inn Express in the USA is better.\nThe rooms are inhuman. They are narrow and high and have bene subdivided vertically so that one has to g up the steep steps to the sleeping area.\nBecause of the odd subdivision and the fact that the large windows toward the outside do not reach till the ceiling, the heat gets trapped in the upper part of the room. In other words, when you try sleeping there you get suffocated by heat.\nThe mattress is very thin, cheap and makes one feel like sleeping on a stone slab.\nDownstairs in the 'living area' there is almost no room to walk around, as narrow as it is.\nThe rooms have no airconditioning, so there is no solution for the heat staying in.\nThe bathroom is a closet, where one person can stand only at the same time. If that person wants to dress he will have to leave the bathroom as there is not sufficient space to turn around decently.\nThe furniture is cheap 1970s dark material, which makes the room even less attractive.\nThe one bright spot was breakfast which was very  sumptuous and there is a nice view over the city with it. It is not inexpensive though and the serving staff is rather surly (as are most Austrians in the guest service business in Vienna).\nThe hotel is also very noisy which limits the amount of sleep one can get and it smells of beer. The reason is that there are many groups/parties celebrating in this hotel and it also advertises itself as a 'conference' hotel.\nThe reception desk staff is the worst we have encountered. When we requested to buy a Vienna public transportation card and asked for it, they first pretended not to understand (I speak German fluently). Then they suddenly said, you mean a 'Vienna Card' and he said so in ENGLISH!. The reception clerk was clearly intent in correcting me. He had understood perfectly well the first time around.\nAfter 3 days we gave up on this hotel and reserved a room elsewhere.\nWhen we contacted the reception desk and told them we wanted to leave early as the room was no good, they looked indifferently and even charged us an extra night cancelation fee!","$":{"CommentId":"2278382","Date":"2006-02-05","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"So this hotel was about what we expected. I read somewhere before booking this hotel that it was only 20 minutes to the city center. While that may hold true (if you know where you're going), it takes twice as much to get to the South Train Station (Sudbahnof). The earliest bus doesn't run until 5:40am so if you travelling by train at 6:30, as we were, don't count on being there on time, we missed our train. That said, it was a pleasent hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was more than adequate. The bed appeared to be two smaller beds on a larger frame which made for a crack in the middle, not one that you could slip through though. The view from the room was exceptional despite the one remarkably tiny window in the room. All said, I would stay here again but only if staying more than two nights. It was simply too removed from the rest of town. Also, the front desk staff was all too unfriendly but the wait staff in the restaurant made up for it.","$":{"CommentId":"2278381","Date":"2006-03-22","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"+the surroundings are excellent, they alone are worth the money.

If that is what you're looking for, than this place will be right up your ally, but if you like to check out sights, and then come home and shower/nap before going out to dinner, you may want to chose somewhere a little closer to the city center.

My partner had booked this weekend trip in Vienna for my birthday & I knew he had booked a lovely hotel but I was blown away! Imagine the scenario, dark, quiet, snowing & a view of Vienna to die for & that was from our bedroom window. I got to the hotel hoping we would have a room on the 1st floor but we were on the ground floor, I was a little disappointed but needn't have been, we could see all over Vienna & got some fantastic pictures. We had a studio room that was split level which made the most of the high ceilings, it made the room feel so much bigger. The bathroom had a fab shower which was really powerful & very spacious. \nThe hotel didn't have all the facilities that we might expect in the UK but you really don't need them. The walks around the hotel are far more beneficial than any gym could be. \nThe 'Power Breakfasts' are lovely and really set you up for a days sightseeing. \nThe staff were very friendly if a little sirly at times but really they can't do enough for you. \nTIP: When leaving Vienna ask to have your bags left at Hotel Europa just off Kartner Strasse then you get the whole day in Vienna instead of going back up to the hotel. Just make sure you agree the transfer price to the airport before you leave, we got taken for a ride...\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to get away from it all after a days sightseeing & walking.","$":{"CommentId":"2278376","Date":"2005-03-01","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"TA"}},{"_":"+The outside view is very nice and the rooms are quite good.","$":{"CommentId":"826434","Date":"2007-05-08","CommenterLanguage":"EN","Source":"BK"}},{"_":"This is a nice quiet location on the hill overlooking Vienna.
